# Restoring a Database from Backup

The pgEdge Starfleet BYOC options offered when you restore from backup will
vary based on the backups available. The source can be from the same database,
or from another database. If you are restoring from a backup taken from another
database, note that:

* the source database must use the same **major** version of Postgres as the
  target version.
* the source and target databases must be part of the same cloud account.

Restoring to all of the nodes in your BYOC database is generally the safest way
to ensure that all nodes are in sync after a restore. If you are not actively
performing writes to your database, or if you have data you maintain only in
specific regions, you might opt to restore only a single node in your database.

To restore a database, select `Restore` from the drop-down `Actions` menu in
the upper-right corner of the `Backups` dialog.

Use fields on the `Restore Database` dialog to describe how you would like to
restore into database nodes:

* Use the `Source Database` field to select the database that will provide the
  backup source; by default, the current database is selected. Note that the
  source database must be in the same cloud account as the target database.
* Use the `Source Node` field to specify the source node from which you wish to
  restore a database backup; available backups are filtered by the selected
  source node.
* Use the `Target Nodes` field to specify one or more nodes that you wish to
  restore the database backup into.
* Use the `Source Repository` field to select the repository that you'd like to
  restore a backup from.
* Select a Restore Method; choose:
    * `Restore a specific backup` to restore the database to the state it was
      in when a specific backup was taken.
    * `Restore to latest point` to restore a database to the latest archived
      state in the repository.
    * `Restore to a specific time` to restore a database to the state it was in
      at a specific time. When the date/time selection fields open, use the
      calendar and time selector or `Relative Time` selector to choose the
      point to which you wish to restore. Note that the point in time you
      specify must be after the first transaction stored in your repository,
      but before the latest transaction archived to the repository.
* Select the `Source Backup` that you would like to restore into the current
  database.

When you've made your selections, type the database name in the confirmation
field and click `Restore Database` to start the restoration process. When the
restore completes, replication sets will be created, and replication will be
restarted if automatic DDL replication is enabled. If automatic DDL replication
is disabled, you will be required to
[use the `Start Replication` button](https://docs.pgedge.com/cloud/database/manage_db#the-start-replication-pane)
to initiate replication of restored tables.

    You can also use the BYOC API to restore from backup; for details, visit
