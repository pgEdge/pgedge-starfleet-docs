# Backing up your Database

Each database has unique backup requirements; pgEdge Starfleet BYOC
allows you to define a backup strategy for your database depending on
your needs.

## Using pgBackRest for Backups

pgBackRest is a reliable backup provider for large databases and
enterprise-level applications. pgBackRest can perform ad hoc backups,
archive WAL, and perform custom backups that support a wide variety of
scenarios.

pgBackRest backups cannot be downloaded, and can currently only be used to
restore data to the same database from which the backup was taken.

When you create a database using pgBackRest as your backup provider, a
backup repository is initialized using the provided Backup Store on each
configured node; that repository is then utilized by pgBackRest to store
data for each node. Backup repositories enable the re-use of Backup Stores
across multiple databases, with paths being used to keep data separate.
These paths are configured to ensure no collision of data occurs:

`/databases/<database_id>/<backup_repository_id>/<node_name>`

When you perform a restore with the pgBackRest repository, a new backup
repository is established for the database across all nodes. The newly
restored database does not overwrite any existing backup data, ensuring you
can attempt a fresh restore from your original backup if needed.

### Customizing Backup Details for pgBackRest

If you use pgBackRest as the backup provider for your database, you can
edit the backup configuration details or define additional backup
configurations for use by your databases. Any changes to the backup
configuration must be performed before the database is deployed.

* To open the `Edit Backup Configuration` dialog and edit the backup
  configuration, select the pencil icon in the upper-right corner of the
  backup details dialog.
* To open the `Add Backup Configuration` dialog and define a new backup
  configuration, select the `+ New Configuration` button.

Select options on the `Add` or `Edit` dialog to customize your backup and
retention policy:

* Specify a node where this configuration will apply, or choose `All nodes`
  to apply this configuration to any nodes in the database where a
  node-specific configuration is not provided.

A default backup configuration is provided that includes schedules that
describe a once-daily full backup and an hourly incremental backup; you can
use options in the `Backup Schedules` section to add new schedules and
delete from existing schedules to refine a backup strategy that suits your
workload:

* To remove a schedule from the configuration, select the `X` to the right
  of a schedule.
* To define a new schedule, provide a user-friendly identifier for a new
  schedule in the `ID` field.
* Select a `Backup Type` for the new schedule; choose:
    * `Full` to schedule a complete backup of the specified nodes.
    * `Incremental` to backup modifications to the database since the last
      backup of any type (whether full, differential, or incremental).
    *  `Differential` to backup changes to the database since the last
       full backup.

* Provide a [Cron expression](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/cron/)
  that details the times and days that backups will be taken in the
  `Frequency` field.

When you've defined the schedule, click the `+` icon to the right of the
schedule definition. This will open another set of fields where you can add
another schedule if desired.

Use the `Repository Storage` field to identify where backups will be stored:

* Choose `Backup Store` to select a pre-configured backup store from the
  drop-down in the `Backup Store` field.
* Choose `Custom Repository` to specify details of a custom storage
  location for backups on your cloud provider. If you choose to use a
  custom repository definition, you will be required to add provider-specific
  information for your cloud storage, and ensure that your cluster has the
  correct IAM permissions to read and write to the storage.

Use the `Repository Retention` selectors to specify how many backups you
would like to retain in storage:

* Use the `Type` selector to indicate if you would like to measure how long
  a backup is stored by length of `time` or backup `count`.
* Use the `Number of days`/`Number of full backups` indicators to specify
  the storage retention.
* Optionally, provide a user-friendly identifier for the configuration in
  the `ID` field.

Select the `Save Configuration` button when you've finished providing
backup configuration details.
 
!!! warning

    Incremental and differential backups will be retained only as long as
    the full backup that provides their baseline.


## Taking a Backup

To take a database backup, select `Backup` from the drop-down `Actions`
menu in the upper-right corner of the `Backups` dialog.

When the `Backup Database` popup opens:

* Optionally, specify a `Backup Name` to identify the backup.
* Use the `Target Nodes` drop-down to select one or more nodes to be
  included in the backup.
* Specify the type of backup in the `Backup Type` field. Choose:
    
    * `Full` to do a complete backup of the selected database and nodes.
    * `Incremental` to backup only those items that have changed since the
      last backup.
    * `Differential` to backup any items that have changed since the last
      *Full* backup.

Use the `Reset` icon to clear the fields, or select the `Backup Database`
button to start the backup.
