# Creating a New Database

To create a new database, select the `Databases` node in the navigation
tree control, then select the `+ New Database` icon in the upper-right
corner of the page. When the `Create New Database` dialog opens, use the
fields to define the database.

- Provide a name for the database in the `Database Name` field.

- Optionally, provide a `Display Name` to identify the database in the
  navigation tree control. If more than one database shares the same name,
  a `Display Name` helps identify each database in the navigation tree
  control.

- Use the `PostgreSQL Version` drop-down to select the version of PostgreSQL
  to install.

The dialog displays the available clusters and their deployment regions.
Use the `Show Map` toggle to display or hide a map of node locations.

Select the cluster to host the new database from the panes displayed under
`Select a Cluster`. Use the checkboxes in each host's selector to indicate
whether the database should be deployed on that host; remove the check to
exclude a specific location.

The `Backup Configuration` pane provides options to customize the backup
configuration for Enterprise Edition database backups.

![Selecting a Backup provider](../images/select_backup_provider.png)

Use the fields in this section to customize the backup strategy; select the
`edit` icon (a pencil) in the upper-right corner to modify backup settings.
The default configuration defines a schedule that includes a daily full
backup with hourly incremental backups. Use the `Add Configuration` button
to [create a custom schedule](../backup/backup_providers.md) for the
database.

!!! note

    A backup configuration and the selected database backup provider cannot
    be modified after database deployment.

The `Options` section displays optional features available when the database
is provisioned:

- Use the toggle switch next to `Enable AWS CloudWatch Metrics` to share
  metrics with [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

Use the `Services` section to add an
[MCP server](https://docs.pgedge.com/pgedge-postgres-mcp-server/v1-0-0/)
or [RAG server](https://docs.pgedge.com/pgedge-rag-server/v1-0-0/) to the
installation.

![Selecting database services](../images/create_db_services.png)

- Select the `+ MCP Server` button to add MCP server details for the database;
  for more information, see [Adding an MCP or RAG Server](../services.md).

- Select the `+ RAG Server` button to add RAG server details for the database;
  for more information, see [Adding an MCP or RAG Server](../services.md).

After making selections, select `Create Database` to initialize a PostgreSQL
database and start replicating data between the nodes in the cluster. The
new database is added to the list of databases in the left pane of the
console; a green dot to the left of the name indicates that the database is
available for connections.
