# Managing a Database

Highlight a database name in the navigation tree to display detailed database
information in the pgEdge Starfleet BYOC console.

![The database console](../images/manage_db.png)

Console content is displayed in a series of panes that simplify database
management; navigate to a pane to review information or perform management
tasks.

## The Database Header

![Database Header](../images/database_header.png)

The database header tells you:

* The name of the database; next to the name, a dot indicates the status of the
  database:
    * A green dot indicates that the database is available for connections.
    * A blue dot indicates that the database is being created.
    * A red dot indicates that the database is not available.

* How long the database has been running.
* The cluster on which the database is deployed.
* The Postgres database version.
* The version of the Spock extension in use by the database.

### Changing the Display Name of a Database

To change the name of a database that is displayed in the navigation pane,
highlight the database name and select `Edit Display Name` from the `Actions`
menu.

![Database Actions menu](../images/actions_database.png)

When the `Change Display Name` popup opens, enter the new database name in the
`Display Name` field and select `Apply`.

## The Get Started Pane

After the header, the console displays the `Get Started` pane; the pane
includes a `PSQL` connection string that you can use to connect to the database
as the `admin` user (a database superuser).

![Get Started](../images/connect_wo_sample.png)

For detailed information about:

* installing the psql client and connecting to the database, see
  [Connecting](../connecting/byoc_index.md).
* moving a database object into your database, see
  [Migrating to pgEdge Starfleet BYOC](../migration/byoc_index.md).
* Postgres SQL commands, see the
[Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-commands.html).

## The Users Pane

![Users Pane](../images/users.png)

The Users pane displays a list of current users. In its initial state, a new
database has roles required to perform administrative tasks. You can use
[psql](../connecting/byoc_psql.md) or [pgAdmin](../connecting/byoc_pgadmin.md)
to
[create additional database users](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-createrole.html).

## Connect to your database

The `Connect to your database` pane displays connection information for the
nodes in your cluster. Select a node tab (from across the top of the pane) and
`User` (`app`, `app_read_only`, or `admin`) to access connection details for a
specific node/user pair.

![The Connect to your database pane](../images/connect_to_your_database.png)

For detailed information about using the connection information to connect to
your database, see [Connecting](../connecting/byoc_index.md).

## Password Management

A random password is generated for each pre-defined `User` when you create a
database; the same user name/password pair can be used to access the database
on each node of the cluster. The associated password and password management
options are located in the `Connect to your database` pane. To access the
password associated with one of the identities (`app`, `app_read_only`, or
`admin`), select the name with the `User` field.

![Password management options](../images/password.png)

### Password Field Options

You can use options in the `Password` field to manage the password assigned to
the `app` user:

* Select `show` to display the password in unobscured form; select `hide` to
  conceal the password.
* Select the `Copy` icon (at the right side of the pane) to copy the password
  in an unobscured (usable) form.
* Select the `Rotate Password` icon (next to the `Copy` icon) to generate a new
  password and assign that password to the currently selected user:

![Updating a password](../images/rotate_password.png)

To confirm that you wish to generate a new password and invalidate the old
password, click the `Rotate Password` button; to exit the dialog without
changing the password, click `Cancel`.

## The Code Snippet Pane

The `Code Snippet` pane displays three code snippets (TypeScript, Python, and
Go) that set the environment variables for your cluster and create a cursor
that lists the nodes in your cluster. Select a tab to review and copy the code.

![Code Snippets](../images/code_snippets.png)

Consider the snippets a starting point for the application developers on your
team.

## The Cluster Map

A map in the pgEdge console displays the nodes in your distributed replication
cluster; hover over a node to display the region name and location.

![The cluster map](../images/cluster_map.png)

## The Usage Pane

If you are using Developer Edition, the `Usage` pane displays a bar graph
showing how much space you have used and available in your cluster. If you are
using Enterprise Edition, database resources are limited only by the size of
your underlying nodes (virtual machines).

![Usage Pane](../images/usage.png)

## Reviewing Node Metrics

The `Node Metrics` section of the console displays an overview of the resources
used by the cluster in the last hour. Tabs across the top of the section allow
you to display the metrics for the entire cluster or select the metrics for an
individual node.

The `All nodes` tab shows bar graphs that compare resource usage for all three
nodes of your cluster.

![Node Metrics](../images/node_metrics.png)

Select the tab for a named node to see activity and resource use for each
individual node of your cluster.

Detailed usage is color coded; select a tab to display details about resource
usage on a specific node. For detailed metrics for a specific point in time,
hover over a graph.

![PIT Metrics](../images/pit_node_metrics.png)

| Command  | Description
|----------|-------------
| `CPU` | The `CPU` graph displays information about the CPU usage for the server.
| `Memory` | The `Memory` graph displays information about memory usage (in MB) for the cluster or by the node.
| `Replication Output` | The `Replication Output` graph displays the replication traffic for the database in tuples.

## Reviewing the Database Logs

A tabbed panel in the `Logs` pane allows you to access database logs for each
cluster node:

![Database log files](../images/db_logs.png)

Use the `Auto refresh`/`Manual refresh` drop-down to specify if the log entries
should update automatically (`Auto refresh`), or to pause updating
(`Manual refresh`) for easier viewing. To manually refresh the log table's
content, select the refresh button to the right of the drop-down.

Use tabs across the top of the panel to select the node for which you wish to
view log files; after selecting the node, choose the log file type:

* Select `PostgreSQL logs` to view the logs from the Postgres database on the
  selected node.
* Select `Tricorder logs` to view Tricorder logs. Tricorder is a companion
  service from pgEdge that enables metrics collection, performs health checks,
  and supports scheduled backups for the database. It also performs operational
  actions on the database as part of workflows.
* Select `ACE logs` to view the ACE extension logs. ACE logs are only available
  for customers that enable ACE monitoring.

You can sort or search the log files using options in the top bar of the log
table:

* Select a column heading to sort alphabetically by the column value; click a
  second time to reverse the sort order.
* Click the filter icon to the right of the `Level` heading to select a status
  from the drop-down; all rows assigned the selected status will be filtered to
  the top of the result set.

![Filtering the database log](../images/database_log_filter.png)

* Use the search box to the right of the `Message` label to enter a search
  string; the search term will be highlighted in the log file entries.
