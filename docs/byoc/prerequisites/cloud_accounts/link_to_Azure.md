# Linking an Azure Account

pgEdge Starfleet BYOC uses an `App Registration` to provision clusters in a
specific `Resource Group` within your Azure subscription. You can create an
`App Registration` and an associated `Client Secret` in the Azure console under
`Microsoft Entra ID` --> `App Registrations`.

You can use a new or existing `Resource Group`. The following roles must be
assigned to the `App Registration` on the `Resource Group` prior to creating a
cluster:

* `Contributor`
* `Key Vault Administrator`
* `Key Vault Data Access Administrator`

To assign a role, navigate to: `Resource Groups` -->
`<Resource Group Name>` --> `IAM` --> `Add role assignment`.

The following resource providers must be registered on the Azure Subscription
to enable API access.

* `Microsoft.Compute`
* `Microsoft.Network`
* `Microsoft.ManagedIdentity`
* `Microsoft.KeyVault`

To register a resource provider, navigate to: `All services` -->
`Subscriptions` --> `<Subscription Name>` -> `Resource Providers`.

Depending on your node locations and Azure Instance Type selection, you may
need to request Quota Increases under `All services` --> `Quotas` --> `Compute`
to ensure that virtual machines can be successfully created in each location.

To link an Azure account with your pgEdge Starfleet BYOC account, select the
`Cloud Accounts` heading in the left navigation pane and then the `+ Link Cloud
Account` button.

Use the fields in the dialog to create a link to your Azure account:

* Provide an account description in the `Account Description` field.
* Provide your Client ID in the `Azure Client ID` field.
* Provide your Client Secret in the `Azure Client Secret` field.
* Provide your Subscription ID in the `Azure Subscription ID` field. To find
  your subscription ID in the Azure console, go to `All services` -->
  `Subscriptions` --> `Subscription ID`.
* Provide your Tenant ID in the `Azure Tenant ID` field. To find your tenant ID
  in the Azure console, go to `Microsoft Entra ID` --> `Properties` -->
  `Directory ID`.
* Provide your Resource Group in the `Azure Resource Group` field.

After providing connection information, select `Link Account` to create a link
to your Azure account.

## Deleting an Account Link

Before deleting an account link, ensure that any resources deployed with pgEdge
Starfleet BYOC have been backed up to your satisfaction and destroyed. Then, to
delete the link to a cloud vendor account, select the menu icon (...) in the
top-right corner of the pane of a linked account.

When the menu opens, select `Unlink Account`.
