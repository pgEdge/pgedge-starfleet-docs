# Using pg_dump for Backups

[pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) is a Postgres tool that can create a script or archive of the settings and commands required to recreate data, a database, or database objects on another PostgreSQL server. You can use pg_dump to move objects into a pgEdge Starfleet BYOC database, or from a BYOC database to another server. pg_dump can also be used as a backup tool.

When using pg_dump with BYOC, you should specify one or more schema names or unique object names in the pg_dump command. The owner of the objects must exist in the database to execute commands to recreate the objects, and must have privileges in the schema in which the objects are being created. You should not backup or attempt to recreate objects in the `spock` schema.

The version of pg_dump and pg_restore that you use must be the same version as the schema or objects that you are recreating. You can invoke pg_dump on the command line or with the pgAdmin graphical client. At the command line, the simplest form of the command is:

`pg_dump -Fp -h domain_name -U user_name -d database_name -n schema_name > path_to_file/target_filename`

Use the `-F` flag to specify a format; `-Fp` generates a plain-text SQL script that can be restored with psql (the default), while `-Ft` produces a tar archive that can be installed with pg_restore.

When prompted, provide the database password. For example, the following command:

`./pg_dump -Fp -h usefully-excited-foxhound-iad.a1.pgedge.io -U admin -d inventory > /Users/susan/Desktop/inventory_backup`

Creates a plain-text file that recreates the `inventory` database; the database resides on a BYOC host with the domain of `usefully-excited-foxhound-iad.pgedge.io`. The commands are written to a plain text file named `inventory_backup`.   For a complete list of pg_dump command line options, see the [documentation at the PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html).

## Using pgAdmin for Backups

The pgAdmin client includes a backup tool that is a front-end for pg_dump; to open the dialog and define a custom or tar formatted backup, right click on a server name in the `Object Explorer` and select `Backup...` from the context menu.

When the `Backup` dialog opens:

* Provide a name for the backup with the file browser in the `Filename` field on the `General` tab.
* If applicable, specify a file format in the `Format` field on the `General` tab.
* Specify the name of a database superuser (or `admin`) in the `Role name` field on the `General` tab.
* Specify your backup preferences on the `Data Options`, `Query Options`, `Table Options`, and `Options` tabs.
* Select the database or database objects for backup on the `Objects` tab.

When the backup completes, you can open the file and review the statements, modify SQL commands, or use the file to recreate objects. For example, the following plain-text dump file of the `fruit` table makes it easy to see how the table is created and populated, how ownership is conveyed, and how key definition is determined.

Note that at the start of the script, any parameters that are not set to default PostgreSQL values are reset to the values in the dump file when the script is replayed. This can potentially modify the behavior of the database into which the script is played back:
