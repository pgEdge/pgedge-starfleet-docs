# Migrating into a Distributed Database

The following steps provide a simple way to move an existing PostgreSQL
database object to a pgEdge Starfleet BYOC database:

1. Create the target database in BYOC.
2. Ensure that the object owner exists in the target database. If necessary,
   connect to the BYOC database with psql or pgAdmin and [create the
   owner](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html) of the
   object. The following simple syntax creates a PostgreSQL role with login
   privileges:

    `CREATE ROLE role_name LOGIN PASSWORD 'safe_password'`

3. If the object is in the `public` schema on the source database, log in to
   the target database and drop the `public` schema. For example:

    `DROP SCHEMA 'public' CASCADE`

4. Run pg_dump against the source database, including the `-Fp` flag to
   generate a plain-text file that recreates the object being moved with SQL
   commands. Include the appropriate [pg_dump
   flags](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/app-pgdump.html) to identify the
   objects that are being included and excluded from the dump file. For
   example:

    ```bash
    pg_dump -Fp -h domain_name -U user_name -d database_name -n schema_name > path_to_file/target_filename
    ```

5. Use psql to replay the script into your BYOC database; simply
   append `< path_to_file/target_filename` to the `PSQL` connection
   string displayed in your BYOC console and press `Return`.
