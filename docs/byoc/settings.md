# Using the Settings Dialog

In the lower-left corner of the pgEdge Starfleet BYOC console you'll find a
link to the `Settings` dialog; you can use the `Settings` dialog to [modify
your profile](#the-profile-tab), create an [API client](#the-api-clients-tab),
[obtain or set account information](#the-team-tab), or review your cluster
nodes on a map.

account; you can also find a link to the `Profile` tab in the user information
drop-down menu (located in the upper-right corner of the screen):

* Provide your first name in the `First name` field.
* Provide your last name in the `Last name` field.

    The email associated with the account cannot be modified.


When you've finished, select `Save` to update your account with the name

You can use options accessed on the API Clients tab, to define and delete API
clients.  To create an client, select the `Create API Client` icon. When the
`Create API Client` popup opens:

* Provide a user-friendly name for the API client in the
  `API Client Name` field.
* Provide a brief description of the API client in the `Description`
  field.

Then, to create the API client, click the `Create` button.

When you create an API client, you will be provided an `Auth ID` and `Auth
Secret` that you can use when connecting to BYOC with the API, and the new
client will be added to the `API Clients` list.
 
!!! warning

    Be sure to copy your `Auth Secret` when it is displayed on the `Client
    created` popup and store it in a safe place; the `Auth Secret` cannot
    be retrieved once the popup is closed.

To delete one or more API client(s), check the box to the left of the client
name and select the `Delete selected client` button, or choose the `Delete`
option from the context menu located to the right of the API client identifiers
in the `API Clients` table. When prompted, click the `Confirm` button to delete
the selected client(s).
