pgEdge Starfleet BYOC uses resources provisioned on your choice of cloud
provider; with BYOC, you can create and manage clusters on the following
providers:

- The AWS cloud platform provides scalable infrastructure services.
- The Azure cloud platform provides Microsoft cloud services.
- The Google Cloud platform provides Google infrastructure services.

When you create a cluster, pgEdge Starfleet BYOC provisions your cluster's
supporting resources on that provider as well; those resources include the
following:

- A backup store provides storage for database backups and recovery.
- An SSH key provides secure authentication to cluster resources.

Before creating your first cluster, you need to link your cloud
provider account with BYOC. Select the `Go to Cloud Accounts` button to
get started.

![Linking an Account](../images/gs_link_cloud_account.png)

Information panes in the center of the page list the credentials and artifacts
you will need to create an account with each provider, as well as a link to the
provider-specific `Setup guide` for detailed information about linking your
account.

When you're ready to get started, select the `Link Cloud Account`
button to choose your provider.

![Selecting a Cloud Provider](../images/gs_select_provider.png)

Choose your provider to open the account details dialog and provide the
information required by each provider to deploy on BYOC.

If you're
[deploying on AWS](../prerequisites/cloud_accounts/byoc_link_to_AWS.md),
you can use the `Create Stack Wizard` to use a completed AWS CloudFormation
template to create an AWS role with the required permissions; use the link
circled in red above to navigate to the wizard and retrieve your ARN.

When you've finished adding a provider account, the new account is displayed on
the `Cloud Accounts` page, and the progress dialog is updated.

Next, you'll create a backup store. You can use the link on the progress
tracker shown above to navigate to a screen that displays information about
backup stores, with a link to a page where you can define a backup store on
your preferred provider.

![Create a Backup Store](../images/gs_backup_store.png)

Select [Create Backup Store](../cluster/byoc_backup_store.md) to navigate to
the `Create Backup Store` dialog; complete the dialog and click `Create
Backup Store` to continue.

When you've finished defining the backup store, the store is displayed on the
`Backup Stores` dialog, and the progress tracker advances, prompting you to
import an SSH key.

Next, you'll [import an SSH key](../prerequisites/byoc_ssh_key.md). You
can use the link on the progress tracker to navigate to an
informational page with links to more information about importing
keys.

![Import an SSH Key](../images/gs_import_ssh_key.png)

When you're ready, select the `Import SSH Key` button to advance to the
import page. When you've finished importing an SSH key, the progress
tracker advances and you can see the imported SSH key on the `SSH Keys`
dialog.

Next, you'll [create a cluster](../cluster/byoc_create_cluster.md). A
cluster is a database container that can house one or more databases
in one or more regions. Single-region clusters are not distributed;
distributed clusters have databases
in multiple regions.

Use the link on the progress tracker to navigate to a page with more
information about cluster creation and handy links.

![Select Create Cluster](../images/gs_create_cluster.png)

To create a cluster, click the `Create Cluster` button; when you've finished
creating a cluster, the progress tracker advances, and you can see the imported
cluster definition on the `Clusters` page.

![Progress tracker](../images/gs_progress_four.png)

Next, you'll create a database. You can use the link on the progress
tracker to navigate to the database creation page.

![Select Create Database](../images/gs_create_database.png)
