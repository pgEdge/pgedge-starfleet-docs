# Managing a Cluster

Use the pgEdge Starfleet BYOC console to review cluster information. Select the
name of a cluster in the `Clusters` menu to access the console for that
cluster.

![The cluster console header](../images/cluster_console_header.png)

If you recently created or modified the cluster, the header displays a banner
showing the cluster state. The console header also displays information about
the selected cluster:

- The cluster name.
- The length of time since the last cluster update.
- The cluster connection type (`Public` or `Private`), which indicates whether
  the cluster nodes are in a public subnet.
- The `Cluster ID` associated with the cluster.
- The name of the cloud provider account on which the cluster resides; select
  the account name to navigate to the details page for the account.
- User-defined [resource tags](byoc_resource_tag.md) associated with the
  cluster.

The cluster header also displays a set of informational panes that show the
state of the cluster at a glance:

- The total node count.
- The number of healthy nodes.
- The number of unhealthy nodes.
- The number of unresponsive nodes.

## The Cluster Information Tabs

![Cluster Overview](../images/cluster_overview.png)

The tabbed browser on the `Cluster` tab provides quick access to information
about the state of the cluster:

- Select the [`Overview`](#the-overview-tab) tab to view information about the
  cluster and the databases currently deployed on the cluster. Detailed
  information about the cluster nodes displays below. Select an icon in the
  `Database` pane to navigate to detailed information about the selected
  database.
- Select the [`Metrics`](#reviewing-cluster-metrics) tab to view details about
  cluster resource use.
- Select the [`Logs`](#reviewing-cluster-log-files) tab to review cluster log
  files.

### The Overview Tab

Select the `Overview` tab to review information about the cluster. Panes on the
`Overview` tab contain links to cluster artifacts:

- Select a database name in the `Databases` pane to navigate to the information
  page for that database.
- Select a backup store name in the `Backup Store` pane to navigate to the
  information page for the store.

The `Nodes` pane contains general node information. Use the tabbed browser to
select a node and review information about that node:

- The `Availability Zone` lists the provider region in which the node is
  deployed.
- Use the `External IP Address` when making connections to the node from a
  public address.
- Use the `Internal IP Address` when configuring VPN connections to the node.
- The `Instance Type` and `Volume Size` details provide node size information.
- The `Instance ID` identifies the node and associated resources in the cloud
  provider console.
- The `UUID` is a unique identifier for cluster resources outside of the cloud
  provider console; use the UUID when making API calls.

When the `Overview` tab is selected, a map displays the locations of the
cluster nodes. Hover over a mapped node to display the name and city in which
the node resides.

The `Overview` tab also displays the currently defined
[Firewall Rules](byoc_firewall.md).

![The cluster's firewall rules](../images/overview_firewall_rule.png)

Select the `Manage Firewall Rules` button to open a dialog to
[modify or create rules](byoc_firewall.md) for the cluster.

The `Overview` tab also displays the current
[VPC Associations](byoc_vpc_assoc.md).

![The cluster's VPC associations](../images/overview_vpc_assoc.png)

Select the `+ Add VPC Association` button to add a new association.

### Reviewing Cluster Metrics

Select the `Metrics` tab to review detailed system resource usage for the
cluster.

![The cluster metrics](../images/cluster_metrics_details.png)

Select from the tabs across the top to review graphs containing:

- Metrics for all nodes in the cluster.
- Metrics for a specific node in the cluster.

The drop-down at the top of the `Metrics` pane specifies the length of time
displayed by each graph.

Select a point on a graph to display information about the graphed event:

![A point-in-time in the cluster metrics graph](../images/cluster_metrics_PIT.png)

The following table describes the available graphs:

| Graph Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| CPU | The percentage of CPU used by the database |
| Memory Usage | Memory used (in MB) |
| Disk Usage | The amount of disk space used (in GB) |
| Running Processes | The number of running processes |
| Network Receive | The amount of data received by the instance |
| Network Send | The amount of data transmitted from the instance |

### Reviewing Cluster Log Files

Select the `Logs` tab to review log files for the cluster.

![The cluster log files](../images/cluster_log_details.png)

Use the tabs across the top to select the nodes for which to review log files,
then select one of the following log types:

- `System logs` reviews the system commands performed to manage the cluster.
- `Docker logs` reviews the Docker-specific commands executed to manage the
  container in which the cluster is running.
- `SSH logs` reviews details about SSH connections made to the cluster.

Use the `Auto refresh`/`Manual refresh` drop-down to specify whether log
entries update automatically (`Auto refresh`) or pause updating
(`Manual refresh`) for easier viewing. To manually refresh the log table's
content, select the refresh button to the right of the drop-down.

Use the controls in the table header to sort or search the selected log file:

- Select a column heading to sort alphabetically by the column value; select a
  second time to reverse the sort order.
- Select the filter icon to the right of the `Level` heading to choose a status
  from the drop-down; all rows assigned the selected status are filtered to the
  top of the result set.

![Filtering the cluster log](../images/cluster_log_filter.png)

- Use the search box to the right of the `Message` label to enter a search
  string; the search term is highlighted in the log file entries. Use the
  navigation arrows to move to the next or previous occurrence of the search
  term.
