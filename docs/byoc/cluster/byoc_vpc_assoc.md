# Adding or Modifying VPC Associations

!!! info

    VPC Associations are currently supported for AWS and Azure clusters.

When you create a pgEdge Starfleet BYOC cluster, you can provide the identity
of a VPC association to configure VPC peering and (if needed) private zone
routing between any defined VPCs and the pgEdge cluster network. Peering allows
an application to connect seamlessly to any of the nodes across regions,
allowing you to fully leverage latency routing and dns failover.

To add or modify a VPC association, highlight the name of a cluster in the
navigation tree and select `Manage VPC Associations` from the
[`Actions`](https://pgedge-docs-sandbox.pages.dev/cloud/mod_cluster/actions)
drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the console.

The `VPC Associations` popup displays the currently defined rules for your
cluster. You can click the `+ Add VPC Association` bar to open a new line (as
shown below) and add a VPC association, or modify the existing entries:

To add or modify a VPC association:

* If applicable, use the `Region` drop-down in the left column to specify the
  region in which the VPC is defined. Support for specifying VPC by region is
  limited to clusters that reside on AWS.

* Use the `VPC ID` field to add or remove VPC IDs from the list.

When you're finished, select `Update VPC Associations` to modify the VPCs
available.
