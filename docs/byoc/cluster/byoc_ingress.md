# Adding an Ingress to a Private Cluster

When you create a private pgEdge Starfleet BYOC cluster, you restrict
access to only those users on your local network.  You can define an
ingress for users not on your network that exposes AI Tooling for use.

!!! note

    An ingress into a private network is used only for services (like AI
    tools), and does not accept Postgres database connections.

To add a network ingress to your cluster, select `Add Ingress` from the
[`Actions`](https://pgedge-docs-sandbox.pages.dev/cloud/mod_cluster/actions)
drop-down menu.

Complete the `Create Ingress` dialog; use the:

* `Name` field to enter a name for the ingress. This name is used
  to identify the ingress in the UI and API.

* `Region` field to select the region where the ingress will be
  created.

After completing the dialog, select the `+ Create Ingress` icon to create the
defined ingress.
