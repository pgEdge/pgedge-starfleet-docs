# Adding a Database or Cluster Node

You can use options on the `Actions` drop-down menu (located in the upper-right
corner of the pgEdge Starfleet BYOC console) to add a database to a node or a
node to a cluster. The menu options are context-sensitive, applying to the
object currently selected in the navigation panel. To access menu options,
select the name of the cluster or database you'd like to modify in the
navigation panel, and then open the `Actions` menu.

## Adding a Node to a Cluster

To add a node to an existing cluster, select the cluster name in the navigation
panel, open the `Actions` menu, and select `Add Nodes`.

When the `Add Node` dialog opens, provide details the new node(s):

* Use indicators on the map or select regions from the drop-down list in the
  `Select regions` field to choose the region(s) in which the new nodes will
  reside.
* Accept the `Default` configuration to use server-assigned network addresses
  or select `Manual` to assign specific addresses for your new node(s).
* Network addresses for the new node(s) are assigned for consistency with the
  rest of your cluster, and are not modifiable.
* The `Instance Type` field displays the value selected for the other nodes in
  your cluster; use the selector to choose an alternative configuration. If you
  are adding more than one node in a single update, the same configuration will
  be applied to both nodes.
* The `Volume Size` field displays the data volume size of the other nodes in
  your cluster; use the selector to choose an alternative size. If you are
  adding more than one node in a single update, the same size will be applied
  to both nodes.

After specifying your preferences, select the `Add Nodes` button to deploy your
new nodes and add them to your cluster. The cluster will be placed in
modification status until the addition is complete; when the update finished,
you will be able to access the new node using the SSH configuration defined
during the initial cluster creation.

!!! tip

    Existing databases are not added to a new node automatically.

## Adding a Database to a Cluster Node

To add a database to a cluster node, select the database name in the navigation
panel, open the `Actions` menu, and select `Add to Nodes`. Note that node must
be [an operational member of the cluster](#adding-a-node-to-a-cluster) before
you can add a database to the node. The node to which you are adding the
database must be a member of the cluster on which the database was created.

When you add a database to a node, BYOC uses
[Spock's Zodan functionality](https://docs.pgedge.com/spock-v5/v5-0-6/modify/zodan/)
to copy the existing data to the new node. Automatic DDL replication is enabled
as the node joins the cluster.

The `Add Database... to Cluster Nodes` dialog opens as shown below:

![Cluster Overview](../images/add_db_to_nodes.png)

On the map, nodes connected by a dotted line are currently replicating the
selected database amongst themselves. Nodes that are not attached to other
nodes by a dotted line are currently not hosting the selected database. To
select a node(s) for updating, click in the `Regions` field to access a list of
available nodes on which the database does not currently reside, or click a
node(s) on the map.

After selecting the node(s), click the `Add Nodes` button to start the
modification process.
