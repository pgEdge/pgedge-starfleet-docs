# Connecting to pgEdge Starfleet BYOC

Any client that can negotiate a connection using libpq can connect to
the PostgreSQL server (port `5432`) on a BYOC database; this applies to
custom clients as well. All authenticating clients must:

* require an SSL connection.
* disable GSS encoding
  ([gssencmode](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT-GSSENCMODE)).
* use an SSH key when connecting.

Additionally, you must open ports for connection when
[creating your cluster](../cluster/create_cluster.md).

## Connecting to a Cluster

You can connect to a BYOC cluster with SSH. IP addresses for each node
in your cluster are displayed on the `Nodes` pane of the Cluster
information dialog.

For detailed information about using SSH to connect to a node, see
[Connecting with ssh](./ssh.md).

## Connecting to a Database

You can use any PostgreSQL client that meets the connection criteria
detailed above to connect to a PostgreSQL database. In this guide, we'll
walk you through connecting with some commonly used clients.
