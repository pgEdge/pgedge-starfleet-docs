# Connecting with SSH

To connect to a pgEdge Starfleet BYOC node with ssh, specify the complete path
and name of your SSH private key in the connection string. You should always
use the identity of the `pgedge` user when connecting to the
`External IP Address` noted in the BYOC console. Use the following signature
when connecting:

`ssh -i path_to_key_file/key_file_name.pem pgedge@external_IP_address`

To locate the `External IP Address`, select the name of the cluster in the BYOC
console navigation pane. Scroll down to the `Nodes` tab, and select the
name/location of the node to which you wish to connect. The first IP address in
the `Node Information` section is the address you should use for SSH
connections.
