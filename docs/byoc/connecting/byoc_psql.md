# Connecting with psql

To locate database-specific PSQL connection properties for your pgEdge
Starfleet BYOC database, double-click a database name in the BYOC console
navigation panel. When invoked on the command line, the `PSQL` connection
string displayed opens the first version of psql it locates in your `$PATH`,
and connects to the database identified in the string.

## Accessing the psql Client

If you created your database without the Northwind sample tables, you'll find
connection properties for your database in the `Get Started` pane of the pgEdge
console. When entered in a Terminal window, the connection string starts the
first copy of psql it locates in your `$PATH` and authenticates with the
permissions of the `admin` user.

If your database has sample tables, the `Connect to your database` pane
displays the connection strings for each node in your cluster, and the unique
connection properties for each pgEdge-created user.

Select a node (`n1`, `n2`, or `n3`) and a `User` to display the connection
properties you can use to authenticate with your database on the selected node:

* The `Database Name` field displays the name of the database specified at
  database creation; if you are using a `Display Name` to make database
  identification easier, the `Database Name` may not be the name displayed in
  the navigation pane.
* The `Password` field obscures the password assigned to each pgEdge-created
  user; use the `show` button to display the password. Use
  [icons](https://docs.pgedge.com/cloud/database/manage_db#password-management)
  to the right of the password to regenerate and copy the password.
* The `Domain` field displays the URL of the database; use the URL (rather than
  an IP address) when connecting to your database.
* The `Connection String` field displays a libpq formatted connection string
  for client applications.
* The `PSQL` field displays a formatted connection string that opens psql at
  the command line and connects to your database.

If you prefer to start psql with a graphical prompt or icon (rather than the
command line) you can use individual clauses found in the connection string to
authenticate:

```bash
PGSSLMODE=require PGPASSWORD=********** psql -h actually-massive-amoeba-iad.pgedge.io -p 5432 -U admin -d receivables
```

When you open psql, the client prompts you for authentication information:

* When prompted for a `Server [localhost]`, provide the server DNS (the clause
  that ends with `.pgedge.io`) and press `Return`. In our example above, the
  server name is: `actually-massive-amoeba-iad.pgedge.io`.
* When prompted for a `Database [postgres]` provide the name of the database
  and press `Return`. In our example, the database name is `receivables`.
* When prompted for a `Port [5432]`, enter `5432` and press `Return`.
* When prompted for a `Username [postgres]`, provide the name of the user in
  your connection string or connection properties, and press `Return`.
* When prompted for the `Password`, provide the password associated with the
  user.

Press `return` to connect to your database:

## Installing psql and Connecting

 To install psql on your local system, follow the platform-specific
 installation and connection details for your server.

### On a Mac

On a Mac, you can use `brew` to install psql at the command line. To install
psql, open a `Terminal` window and enter:

`brew install libpq`

When `brew` completes, use the following command to ensure that the version of
psql that you've just installed is the first version in your PATH:

`echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`

Then, to connect to a new pgEdge PostgreSQL database, use the copy button to
the right of the connection string in the `Get Started` section to copy the
connection string of your database; then paste the string in the `Terminal`.

Press `Return` to connect to the server with the psql client.

### On Linux

On a Linux system, install the `postgresql` package with your platform-specific
package manager; for example, on a Rocky Linux host, use `yum`:

`yum install postgresql`

This command installs psql in `/usr/bin/psql`. After installing, you can
connect to the database with the connection string provided by the pgEdge
console.

For detailed information about installing PostgreSQL packages on Linux, visit
the [PostgreSQL Downloads page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

### On Windows

For detailed information about installing PostgreSQL on Windows, visit the
[PostgreSQL downloads page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).
After installing PostgreSQL, you can navigate through the Windows menu to open
the psql client.
